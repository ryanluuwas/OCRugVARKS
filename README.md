**Conclusions**
* Age group 1 (18-29) and 3 (60+) are more willing to subscribe to a term deposit.
* Those who sucessfully subsribed in the previous marketing campaign are much more likely to subcribe for a term deposit.
* The probability of a client declining to a subcription significantly drops after 8 attempts.
* With this information, we hope the callers strategically spend their call times onto the target audience, thus efficiently utilizing the time and resources of the company.

**Limitations of our Analyses**
* The predictive model we built in determining whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit may not be accurate in 2019 because Portugal's 2019 economy heavily differs than that of its 2008-2010 economy, which was during and near the Great Recession.
* Due to an imbalance of classifiers, we used synthetic data to better train the random forest model. Our original model without synthetic data had a 91% overall accuracy but more than 50% false negative rate. Our improved model sported a 87% overall accuracy but had a 20% false negative rate. Despite the lower overall accuracy, our new model showed to be more well-rounded in class error. Overall accuracy is sometimes not the best indicator of a model's performance. 
* Although synthesizing data for our classification model leads to no information loss, we increased the risk of overfitting the model since it replicates the minority class events
